##### System Design and Failure Modes

The Boeing 737 MAX program introduced significant system-level risk through the interaction of aerodynamic changes, control software authority, and limited system transparency. To preserve handling characteristics consistent with earlier 737 variants, Boeing implemented the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) to counteract pitch-up tendencies resulting from altered engine placement. From a systems engineering perspective, MCAS increased risk by relying on limited sensor redundancy, exercising repeated authority over flight control surfaces, and operating with minimal pilot awareness. While each of these design decisions could be justified independently, their interaction produced a tightly coupled system with low tolerance for sensor failure and limited opportunities for human intervention, increasing the likelihood of catastrophic outcomes under rare but plausible conditions [1].

##### Stakeholders and Risk Distribution

The primary stakeholders in the 737 MAX system included Boeing engineers and management, airline operators, pilots, regulators, and passengers. However, risk was not distributed evenly among these groups. Design authority and decision-making power resided primarily with engineers, management, and certification bodies, while pilots and passengers bore the consequences of system failure with limited knowledge of MCAS behavior or failure modes. This asymmetry is ethically significant: those most exposed to harm had the least ability to influence design decisions, training requirements, or system disclosure. From an engineering ethics standpoint, such imbalances demand heightened responsibility from those with technical and institutional control.

##### Organizational Constraints and Regulatory Structure

Organizational and regulatory structures strongly shaped engineering decisions throughout the 737 MAX development process. Competitive pressure to minimize pilot retraining costs and accelerate certification incentivized treating MCAS as a minor system change rather than a safety-critical control feature. Concurrently, regulatory frameworks that relied heavily on manufacturer self-certification reduced the degree of independent technical scrutiny. These conditions did not require unethical intent to produce unsafe outcomes; instead, they created an environment in which safety margins were systematically compressed to satisfy schedule, cost, and certification constraints. Engineers operating within these structures could make locally rational decisions that collectively increased system-level risk [2].

##### Ethical Responsibility Beyond Compliance

The ASME Code of Ethics requires engineers to “hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public” and to exercise independent judgment in the performance of their professional duties [3]. While the 737 MAX program achieved regulatory compliance, ethical responsibility extends beyond meeting minimum standards. Design choices that reduced redundancy, constrained pilot understanding, and limited training conflicted with the broader obligation to protect public welfare, even if they satisfied formal requirements. This case highlights the ethical gap between compliance-based safety and outcome-based responsibility. From an ASME perspective, adherence to process cannot substitute for accountability for real-world consequences.

##### Dissent, Escalation, and Professional Risk

Whistleblowing and internal dissent represent critical but constrained mechanisms for ethical intervention in engineering organizations. Engineers who recognize systemic risk may face professional retaliation, reputational harm, or career stagnation when escalating concerns that conflict with organizational priorities. Although ASME ethics emphasize responsibility to the public, organizational cultures often discourage escalation by framing safety concerns as obstacles to progress or efficiency. In the absence of structural protections, ethical action depends disproportionately on individual moral courage rather than robust governance. This reliance is itself a system-level failure, as ethical responsibility should not hinge on personal risk tolerance.

##### Ethics as a System Design Constraint

The 737 MAX crisis demonstrates that ethical failure in engineering is rarely the result of individual negligence or incompetence. Instead, it emerges from the interaction of technical complexity, organizational incentives, and regulatory structures that normalize risk and diffuse responsibility. An ASME-aligned approach to engineering ethics requires treating safety not as a compliance milestone, but as a system-level design constraint that governs technical decisions, organizational processes, and regulatory engagement. Ethical engineering, therefore, is not an abstract ideal—it is a requirement for designing systems that remain safe under real-world pressures and uncertainty.
