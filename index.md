## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Rajarshi Das, and I am a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. I am drawn to engineering problems that require both technical rigor and thoughtful decision-making — situations where understanding the system matters more than rushing to a solution.

##### Values & Approach
Through project teams and independent work, I’ve learned to value structure, documentation, and iteration. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, asking why something behaves the way it does, and rebuilding it in a way that is clearer, more robust, and easier for others to work with.

##### Technical Interests
My technical interests center on building clean, reliable systems that can be tested, expanded, and iterated over time. My work spans failure analysis and material selection, mechatronic system design, and manufacturing-focused prototyping, with an emphasis on how electromechanical systems come together at their interfaces.

##### Hands-On Experience
I have hands-on experience with CNC machining, 3D printing, and mold-based fabrication, and I am actively expanding into PCB design and embedded electronics to strengthen system-level integration. Through projects like Autoboat, I focus on designing hardware that supports future iterations rather than one-off solutions, with careful attention to design-for-manufacturability.

##### Teaching & Mentorship
I also enjoy teaching and mentoring. I like breaking systems down to their fundamentals and rebuilding understanding from first principles, especially when documentation or instruction is unclear. Clear explanations and reusable knowledge are as important to me as clean designs.

------------

Outside of engineering, I care deeply about curiosity and balance. I am an avid cyclist, participate in western equestrian riding, and enjoy learning new skills simply for the sake of learning them. These experiences shape how I approach engineering: reflection is just as important as execution.

This site is a collection of my work, projects, and interests as I continue developing as an engineer, teammate, and collaborator.
